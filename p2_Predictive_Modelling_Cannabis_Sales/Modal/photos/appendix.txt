Correlaton:
1. out of all the 161 independent variables, we checked the data types of all the variables.
2. We removed the numerical and categorical variables and only kept the numerical variables.
3. We calculated the pearson correlation,using proc corr which helped to shorlist our independent variables to 119 
which are statistacially significant to the 95% confidence interval


EDA:
Out of all the independent Variables we selected the top 8 variables we got from the correlation as a sample for Explorator Data Analysis.
These Top 8 Variables are:

Final Model:
1.To find the most important variables in final model we further shorlisted the variables using stepwise regression model.
2. Using Stepwise Regression we were able to shorlist the variables we got from correlation from 119 to 72
3. We checked the all these variables and remove similar variables and find the 14 most important variableswhich have meaning contribution to the model.
